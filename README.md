# Next-First

Throughout the development of this repository, I embarked on a journey to master Next.js, a powerful framework for building modern web applications. One of the key highlights of this project is the successful implementation of authentication in Next.js, a feat I achieved thanks to the invaluable guidance and teachings of Hitesh Chaudhary. His comprehensive course on FreeCodeCamp's YouTube channel was an absolute game-changer, providing me with the knowledge and skills to make this project possible.
